1. If an existing RPID is used and the existing Rendering Account is Inactive,

if the existing Account has same NPI and PT, the analyst should be informed about it and on consent the existing Inactive 
account should be removed (marked deleted) and new Account should be created. -> The messaging is implemented as per Manju under KEN-29191.(workimng fine)

If the existing Account has different NPI or PT, then the analyst should be informed that this is error. 
He should change the RPID to proceed to create a new Account. Otherwise if the Analyst wants to proceed without changing the RPID, 
then the existing account should be marked deleted and the new Account should be created. 
The messaging will be implemented as per Manju under KEN-29191 which will restrict the account from being created right now. 
Later it will be improvised to create account.  (SHOULD RESTRICT in app iud/warning msg)

2. If an existing RPID is used and the existing Rendering Account is Active,
If the existing Account has the same NPI and PT, the analyst should be informed about it and on consent only the affiliation 
should get created with the existing Account. The messaging is implemented as per Manju under KEN-29191.----(Working FINE)----deleing second account--working fine(priyanka)

If the existing Account has different NPI or PT, then the analyst should be informed that this is error. 
He should change the RPID to proceed to create a new Account. Otherwise, if the analyst wants to proceed without changing the RPID, 
then the existing account should be marked deleted and the New Account should be created. 
The messaging is implemented as per Manju under KEN-29191 which will restrict the account from being created right now.
 Later it will be improvised to create account.  (As of now it is displaying rendering id should be unique)

3. If a new RPID is used but the NPI and PT are same as on -
 a)An existing Inactive Rendering Account - then the analyst should be questioned that he wants to create new RPID for an existing NPI + PT Account? 
    If analyst says yes, then PAVE creates a new Account.


b)An existing Active Rendering Account - then the analyst should be informed that he is trying to create new RPID for an existing NPI + PT Account? 
If analyst says yes, then PAVE creates a new Account.(ISP---SAME NPI+SAME SERVICESS ADDRESS+SAME PT priyank is creating)

I have listed all the possible scenarios here, but we can rearrange these to align as per the implementation flow.
These scenarios should be handled at the time of Account Creation as well as in IUD when Analyst enters the RPID, wherever applicable.

4.If a new RPID is used but the NPI+PT+SERVICE ADDRESS are same as on -
 a)An existing active Rendering Account - THEN again flip is happening deleted second rendering account
