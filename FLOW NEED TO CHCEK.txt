Crossover Providers
A crossover provider can enroll as either a group or individual dental provider.
For both crossover types the rendering information would be needed.
The other requirements that are already in the PAVE system would be similar for the dental crossover providers.
Rendering providers would need to be able to be added after the crossover is created as well (for the group).
For the rendering provider the specialty code set is 70 and no other rendering provider has this specialty code.
In the choices for specialty type 70 should not be shown.
On the enrollment side, if the Rendering Provider is a crossover only, the Billing Provider ID will start with a D.
Crossover providers from MMIS would need to be saved with any additional flag or something by PMF Load process? @Dev ??
